This is a small night-project I set up mostly for the fun of it, and partly because I
tend to want to know the current week, but never check it in my Google Calendar.
This allows me to see it monday morning on my way to work while browsing other tweets.

Makes use of the python-twitter API-wrapper, http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/
Icon is from http://dryicons.com/icon/coquette-icons-set/calendar-empty/

Feel free to use it!
